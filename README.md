# Comprendo Service

A service supporting the Comprendo command-line tool for generating language learning content.

This could also be considered example code for implementing text-to-speech via AWS. But since there is a fair amount of configuration to do in AWS, this code by itself doesn't tell the whole story. I recommend the tutorial by Manoj Fernando at https://enlear.academy/how-to-build-a-speaking-app-with-aws-polly-56025561b854.

## If You Do Use This Code

You'll need to add a file called aws-config.ts under the "private" directory and provide exported string constants matching your particular AWS configuration. The compiler will complain about specific variables that aren't defined, and those are the ones to define.

### Contributing
